# GreenDAO
A community governance platform for sustainability projects. Each vote is tracked transparently, and the results are publicly visible. Eventually, I plan to integrate blockchain and wallet support to securely record every vote and contribution.

**Features**
Interactive project voting system
Real-time transparency display of votes
Clean, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
Planned blockchain integration with MetaMask and ethers.js

**Installation**

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GreenDAO.git

Navigate into the project folder:
cd GreenDAO

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm start

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000

**Usage**

Go to the Projects page to view projects and cast votes.
Votes are tracked and reflected in the Transparency page in real time.
The frontend simulates voting for now; blockchain integration is planned.

**Future Plans**

Connect MetaMask for real on-chain voting
Add a funding module for community contributions
Add analytics to visualize project impact and engagement

**Technologies Used**

Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, React Router
State Management: React useState & useEffect
Blockchain / Web3 (planned): MetaMask, ethers.js
